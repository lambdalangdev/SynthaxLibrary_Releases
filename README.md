# SynthaxLibrary_Releases
Synthax is a Processing library dedicated to exploring and fostering inquiries into notational schemes. If assessed within standard categories, Synthax might straddle the realms of Language and Mathematics. However, within these conventional classifications, it not only underperforms but risks redundancy in its purpose.

Alternatively, Synthax is best understood as a fully functional thought experiment on the symbolic. It offers usable tools for exploring notions of 'context', 'denotation', 'notation', and 'identity' across representational systems. With its structuring and lexicon, Synthax aligns more closely with the notion of a translation library, profoundly influenced by Goodmanian principles.
